# Local-Library-Project

## Live Site

Built using [Vercel](https://local-library-project-doj57c829-mariahcasciola.vercel.app/).

## Description

This project displays data from a mock Local Library. Using a boiler plate UI, I created function higher order functions to properly display the information about the library's books, authors, and borrowers.

[Overall Stats](https://local-library-project-doj57c829-mariahcasciola.vercel.app/index.html)

+ Dashboard displaying General Stats, Most Common Genres, Most Popular Books, and Most Popular Authors.

[Stats by Books](https://local-library-project-doj57c829-mariahcasciola.vercel.app/books.html)

+ Displays a list of books and whether they are returned or loaned out.

+ Each book also displays a list of recent borrowers, when clicked.

[Stats by Account](https://local-library-project-doj57c829-mariahcasciola.vercel.app/accounts.html)

+ Displays a list of user accounts you can select every user account and see what books each user has in their possession.

+ Clicking a user's name will render their account details and what books are borrowed by this account to the right of the screen.
